# The Math Game
<b>What is the game all about?</b></br>
This is a two player game. In this game, there is a collection of 'n' balls. Both the players select a number (taking into considerations the constraints) and then every player to make a move, takes out balls equal to the GCD of the number selected by him and the remaining balls in the collection. The player who first fails to make a move loses (i.e a player loses if there are strictly less number of balls then the GCD of the number selected by him and the remaining balls). I leave it onto you to think it on, the lesser complicated way.<br>

<b>What have I learnt during the development of this game?</b></br>
Well, a lot of things. After building the <b>CSS-Robot</b> and <b>The Madlibs Game</b>(Where I was having fun with Jquery), here is my next project. I learnt implementation of some simple algorithms and writing their code in Javascipt. So, in short, I practiced, or I should say, learnt by practice, the implementation of simple algorithms in Javascipt, moving between the function call, some simple techniques etc. I also came across many amazing functions and many insanely surprising modules of JS while making this. (Though, I haven't used any sunch insanely astonishing modules in this project. But, atleast I know that I can work with them when the need arises). 

I look forward to exploring some more modules and make this project more practical and better. Please report bugs and issues immediately. You can mail them to me directly at mohtamohit@gmail.com.

Happy Gaming. :)
